<p>The recent zoning proposals by the city council could have a significant impact on our neighborhoods. It's crucial for every resident of Fitchburg to understand the potential changes and what they mean for the future of our city. In this post, we'll break down the key points of the proposal, analyze the potential environmental and community impacts, and outline how you can make your voice heard.</p>
<p>One of the primary concerns is the rezoning of several areas near vital wetlands. These changes could pave the way for development that threatens local water quality and wildlife habitats. We will explore the specific parcels in question and discuss the protections currently in place under the Clean Water Act.</p>
<h2>Key Changes to Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Residential Density Increases:</strong> The proposal calls for higher density allowances in several single-family home neighborhoods.</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial Rezoning near Wetlands:</strong> Certain protected areas are being considered for commercial development, which raises significant environmental flags.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Setbacks:</strong> The distance required between new construction and property lines, including those adjacent to streams, may be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage all citizens to review the official documents, attend the upcoming public hearings, and contact their city representatives. Your engagement is vital to ensuring responsible development in Fitchburg.</p>

<p>Our city's groundwater is a precious resource, but it's facing increasing threats from pollution and over-extraction. This article provides an overview of the hydrogeology of the Fitchburg area and discusses the primary sources of contamination that are impacting our wells and streams.</p>
<h2>Sources of Contamination</h2>
<p>Runoff from industrial sites, agricultural chemicals, and failing septic systems are major contributors to groundwater pollution. We will look at recent water quality reports and identify the key contaminants of concern, such as nitrates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p>
<p>Fitchburg Civic Integrity is advocating for stronger local ordinances to protect our groundwater resources. This includes promoting sustainable land use practices, investing in modern water treatment infrastructure, and holding polluters accountable.</p>
